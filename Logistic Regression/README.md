# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Implementation of the logistic regression

- Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification purposes as well as for calculating probabilities.
- The solver parameter in LogisticRegression() function specifies the algorithm to be used in the optimization problem during the training of the logistic regression model. In this case, solver='liblinear' indicates that the optimization algorithm to be used is 'liblinear'.
- A sparse dataset is a dataset in which most of the feature values are zero. Sparse datasets can arise in various applications, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and recommender systems. In the case of logistic regression, sparsity can lead to computational efficiency gains because the algorithm can exploit the structure of the data and only consider the non-zero feature values
